        This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
        vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore
        vertical white spaces and render all the text as one single set of
        sentences. To force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the
        paragraphs you want to separate with the paragraph tag
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-2">
        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
        vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-3">
        This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
        gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
        browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
        the right.
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-4">
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
        tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
        and typesetting industry.

        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
        text ever since the 1500s.

        The paragraph tag is a block-level element, so each one starts on its
        own line instead of flowing into the text around it. Browsers also
        apply a default top and bottom margin to every paragraph, and that
        margin is what shows up as the vertical gap between them.
